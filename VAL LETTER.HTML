      <div class="greeting">Rahama Maltiti,</div>

      <section class="body">
        <p>From the first time our paths crossed I felt something <span class="em">gentle and certain</span> settle in my chest. We started as two curious people learning each other’s rhythms—laughing at the same small things, testing the edges of honesty, and discovering how easy it is to feel at home in someone else’s presence. Those early days are still bright in my mind because they taught me how beautiful it is to choose someone every single day.</p>

        <p>We have not been spared hard days. We’ve argued, misread each other, and wrestled with timing, distance, and the pressures life throws at us. There were nights when silence felt heavier than words, and moments when pride kept us from saying what we needed most: <span class="em">“I’m sorry,” “I see you,” “I need you.”</span> Through those struggles I learned patience, how to listen without planning my reply, and how to hold space for your fears as well as your joys. Each difficulty has been a lesson that softened me and made our bond more honest.</p>

        <p>What I love most about us is how we keep returning to one another—imperfect, hopeful, and willing to try again. You have been my mirror and my shelter; you’ve celebrated my small wins and steadied me when I stumbled. Your kindness has taught me to be kinder to myself, and your courage has pushed me to be braver in love. I don’t take for granted the ways you show up: the quiet check-ins, the laughter that breaks through a bad day, the way you remember the little things that matter to me.</p>

        <p>You once called this our <span class="em">“one and a half”</span> relationship, and I hold that phrase like a promise. It tells me we are already more than a beginning but still growing toward something fuller. My hope—my promise—is that we let this “one and a half” become whole. I want us to keep building trust, to keep choosing honesty over comfort, and to make space for both our individual dreams and the life we’re shaping together. I want to be the person who learns from our past, fights for our present, and plans for a future where we both feel safe, seen, and celebrated.</p>

        <p>If you’ll have me, I will keep showing up: with patience when things are hard, with celebration when things go right, and with steady work when love needs tending. I will listen more, apologize sooner, and hold your hand through whatever comes next. I believe in us—enough to do the small, steady things that make a relationship last.</p>
